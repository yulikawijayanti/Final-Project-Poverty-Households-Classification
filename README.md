## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the percentage of poverty in Bali Province. To overcome this, various efforts and programs for poor households have been carried out by the government. However, the realization has not been optimal and indicated not on target. Therefore, the model needed to classify households into poor or non-poor categories.

## Project Description

This study aims to determine the classification performance of random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models with or without handling imbalanced data and choose the best model. It used data from The National Socio-Economic Survey for March 2020 in Bali Province. The methods of handling imbalanced data are random undersampling, random oversampling, and SMOTE.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7.0
